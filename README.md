# Performance Boggle (deprecated)

This repo provides pure C++ code for scoring [Boggle] boards, as well as implementations in Go and Java.

This repo hasn't been actively developed since ~2012. Work has moved over to the [hybrid-boggle] repo, which uses a mix of C++ and Python.

If it's of interest, you can still find the original [README](/README).
